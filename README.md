- Sound effects synchronized with sorting operations
- Interactive and resizable plot window

#### Installation
Include instructions on how to install any dependencies and run your project.


1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/sorting_visualization.git
   cd sorting_visualization
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
